# IVLoadingScreenExtender
A simple IV-SDK .NET mod for GTA IV which extends the loading screen by a configurable amount of time.

## Why?
I've read multiple times over the past few years that people would like to extend the loading time to enjoy the loading music of GTA IV a bit more. Well, i guess now its time to give the 5 people what they want!  
Actually this mod can be useful for people who added a new loading theme to the game, and want to fully showcase it on YouTube.

## How to Install
Just put all the files from the downloaded archive inside the `scripts` folder located within the `IVSDKDotNet` directory.  

## Things you can do
- You can change the time for how long the loading screen will be extended within the `IVLoadingScreenExtender.ini` file.
- Pressing the "**S**" key while loading will make it so that the game will continue to load normally without the extended loading time.

## Requirements
- [IV-SDK .NET v1.9 or above](https://github.com/ClonkAndre/IV-SDK-DotNet)
